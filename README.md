# tedge-standalone

## TODO

* check how to update tedge binary (custom sm-plugin?)
* create wrapper script for tedge init manager interactions, though maybe it is not needed

## Bootstrapping

Run the start.sh script to run the bootstrap process to create a certificate and connect thin-edge.io

```sh
/data/tedge/start.sh
```
